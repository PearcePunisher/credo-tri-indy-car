# Notification Bombardment Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Deprecated Warning Fix
**Problem**: `shouldShowAlert` is deprecated in expo-notifications
**Solution**: Replaced with `shouldShowBanner` and `shouldShowList`

**Files Updated**:
- `hooks/useEnhancedNotifications.ts`
- `hooks/useNotifications.ts` 
- `components/NotificationTray.tsx`
- `services/PushTokenService.ts`

**Change**:
```typescript
// Before
shouldShowAlert: true,

// After  
shouldShowBanner: true,
shouldShowList: true,
```

### 2. Auto-Subscription Bombardment Fix
**Problem**: 100+ notifications being scheduled on every schedule page load
**Solution**: Enhanced logging, duplicate prevention, and debugging tools

#### Enhanced Auto-Subscription Logic
- Added detailed console logging to track auto-subscription process
- Added notification count tracking before/after operations
- Improved future event filtering with corrected timezone
- Added protection against scheduling notifications for past events

#### Duplicate Prevention
- Cancel existing notifications before scheduling new ones in `scheduleExperienceNotifications()`
- This prevents accumulation of duplicate notifications

#### Debugging Tools Added
- `clearAutoSubscriptionStatus()`: Reset auto-subscription state
- `clearAllNotifications()`: Clear all scheduled notifications
- `getScheduledNotificationCount()`: Check current notification count
- `NotificationDebugger` component: UI for testing notification functions

## Key Changes Made

### ExperiencesService.ts
1. **Enhanced Auto-Subscription Logging**:
   ```typescript
   console.log(`ðŸ”” Processing ${experiences.length} experiences for auto-subscription`);
   console.log(`ðŸ”” Auto-subscribing to: ${experience.experience_title} (starts: ${correctedEventTime.toLocaleString()})`);
   console.log(`ðŸŽ‰ Auto-subscription complete! Subscribed to ${subscriptionCount} future experiences.`);
   ```

2. **Duplicate Prevention**:
   ```typescript
   // First, cancel any existing notifications for this experience to prevent duplicates
   await this.cancelExperienceNotifications(experience.id);
   ```

3. **New Debugging Methods**:
   - `clearAutoSubscriptionStatus()`: For testing
   - `clearAllNotifications()`: Clear all notifications
   - `getScheduledNotificationCount()`: Monitor notification count

### Schedule.tsx
1. **Enhanced Logging**:
   ```typescript
   const notificationCountBefore = await experiencesService.getScheduledNotificationCount();
   console.log(`ðŸ“Š Notifications before loading: ${notificationCountBefore}`);
   ```

2. **Temporary Debugging Component**:
   - Added `NotificationDebugger` component for testing
   - Provides UI buttons to check counts and clear notifications

### NotificationDebugger.tsx (New Component)
- **Check Notification Count**: See how many notifications are scheduled
- **Clear Auto-Subscription**: Reset auto-subscription status for testing
- **Clear All Notifications**: Emergency clear all scheduled notifications

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **First Time User**: 
   - Gets auto-subscribed to future events only
   - Auto-subscription happens once and is tracked
   - Each event gets exactly 3 notifications (1hr, 20min, at-time)

2. **Returning User**:
   - No auto-subscription (respects existing choices)
   - No bombardment of notifications

3. **Deprecated Warnings**: 
   - Should be eliminated with new notification properties

## Testing the Fix

1. **Clear Previous State**:
   ```typescript
   // Use NotificationDebugger component or console
   await experiencesService.clearAutoSubscriptionStatus();
   await experiencesService.clearAllNotifications();
   ```

2. **Monitor Logs**: Check console for auto-subscription process
3. **Check Counts**: Use debugging component to see notification counts
4. **Verify Timing**: Ensure notifications fire at correct times with 6-hour offset

## Production Cleanup

Before production, remove:
- `NotificationDebugger` component from schedule page
- Detailed console logging in auto-subscription process
- Debug methods (or keep them but don't expose in UI)

## Root Cause Analysis

The bombardment was likely caused by:
1. Auto-subscription running on every schedule page load
2. No cancellation of existing notifications before scheduling new ones
3. Possible issues with AsyncStorage persistence of auto-subscription status
4. Multiple instances of the same notifications being scheduled

The enhanced logging and duplicate prevention should resolve all these issues.
