# Video Player Setup Instructions

## Overview
The full-screen video player has been successfully added to your IndyCar app. Here's what was implemented:

## Features
- **Full-screen video playback** with custom controls
- **Continue button** appears when video finishes, redirecting to the Welcome page
- **Play/pause controls** with touch overlay
- **Progress bar** showing current playback position
- **Close button** to exit the video player
- **Loading indicator** while video loads
- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes

## Navigation Integration
- Added a "Watch Video" tile to the main navigation grid in `/app/(tabs)/navigation.tsx`
- Uses a play-circle icon from Ionicons
- Positioned between FAQ's and Feedback tiles

## Video File Management
- Your existing video file was renamed from "Justin Bell CEDO Motorsport intro-optimized-apple.mp4" to "justin-bell-cedo-motorsport-intro.mp4" (removed spaces for better compatibility)
- Located in `/assets/videos/` directory
- The video player automatically loads this file

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Navigate to the main VIP navigation screen
2. Tap the "Watch Video" tile with the play icon
3. Video will start playing automatically in full-screen
4. Tap anywhere on the video to show/hide play/pause button
5. When video finishes, a "Continue to Welcome" button appears
6. Tap "Continue" to navigate to the Welcome page
7. Use the X button in the top-right to close the video at any time

### For Developers:
To change the video file:
1. Add your MP4 file to `/assets/videos/` directory
2. Update the `videoSource` in `/app/video.tsx` on line 23:
   ```tsx
   const videoSource: VideoSource = require('@/assets/videos/your-new-video.mp4');
   ```
3. Adjust the continue button timer in `/app/video.tsx` on line 38 to match your video's duration:
   ```tsx
   const continueTimer = setTimeout(() => {
     setShowContinue(true);
   }, 32000); // Change 32000 to your video length in milliseconds
   ```

## File Structure
```
/app/video.tsx                 - Full-screen video player component
/app/(tabs)/navigation.tsx     - Main navigation with video tile
/assets/videos/               - Video files directory
  └── justin-bell-cedo-motorsport-intro.mp4
```

## Technical Details
- Uses the modern `expo-video` package (migrated from deprecated `expo-av`)
- Implements proper color theming from your Colors constant
- Follows your coding standards with proper color scheme usage
- Uses simplified timer-based approach for video completion detection
- Uses React hooks for state management (loading, playback status)
- Auto-shows continue button after estimated video duration (32 seconds)

## Migration from expo-av
The video player has been updated to use the new `expo-video` package which replaces the deprecated `expo-av`. Key changes:
- `VideoView` component instead of `Video`
- `useVideoPlayer` hook for player management
- Simplified event handling approach
- Better performance and future compatibility

## Testing
To test the video player:
1. Start your Expo development server: `npx expo start`
2. Navigate to the main screen in your app
3. Tap the "Watch Video" tile
4. Verify the video plays, controls work, and continue button appears when finished

The video player is now fully integrated and ready to use!
